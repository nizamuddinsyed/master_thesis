# Roadlytics: Minimizing Traffic Congestion in Hamburg

## Problem Statement
The project aims to tackle the growing issue of traffic congestion in the city of Hamburg, particularly caused by logistic vehicles. The problem impacts not only the economy but also contributes to increased carbon emissions.

## Solution
A portable, low-cost vehicle tracking device has been developed using Internet of Things (IoT) technology. The device collects precise geolocation data, which is then analyzed using Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to provide real-time insights and solutions to minimize traffic congestion.

## Technologies Used
- Internet of Things (IoT)
- Machine Learning (ML)
- Artificial Intelligence (AI)

## How to Use
The project is primarily research-based and aims to be implemented on a larger scale in the city's infrastructure.

## Results
The results are discussed in detail in the Master's thesis. The proposed solution has been tested and shows promise in effectively reducing traffic congestion.
